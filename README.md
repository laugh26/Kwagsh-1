Kwagsh is a core implementation of CryptoNote. It is open source and completely free to use without restrictions. Anyone is welcome to contribute to Kwagsh's codebase! If you have a fix or code change, feel free to submit is as a pull request directly to the "master" branch. In cases where the change is relatively small or does not affect other parts of the codebase it may be merged in immediately by any one of the collaborators. On the other hand, if the change is particularly large or complex, it is expected that it will be discussed at length either well in advance of the pull request being submitted, or even directly on the pull request.
